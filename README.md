# Foliage  viz

Jekyll site for trend special projects with assets for foliage project here:

* http://projects.ctmirror.org/content/trend/2016/10/foliage/

# Usage

use

    $ jekyll build

to build _site folder

# Notes

This is my first jekyll project. I abandoned the "_posts" feature, but left the dir in place. Instead, the more typical use case would be to build the project in index.html, extending one of the templates, since this is for mostly one-page projects.
